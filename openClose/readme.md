## Open And Close Github

- A cheeky little script made for fun to open your github profile and close the window after a few seconds. 
- Can be used to increase your profile views as most profile views counters work on how many times a profile is visted or refreshed.

### Run 
./popular.sh `YOUR-USERNAME`

Example: ./popular.sh `Umar-Waseem`


`close.bat` consists of a command for windows based terminals that closes the chrome browser.
